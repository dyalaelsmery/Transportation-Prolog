 A trip plan details the journeys that a student belong to particular group will need to take from their
 home to the university campus. The trip takes into consideration that the student might be able to reach
 multiple stations from their home, in addition to being able to reach the campus from multiple stations.
 The plan consists of a journey for each day that a student needs to be on campus, as they need to arrive
 on time for the earliest scheduled slot for that day. The journey of each day details the duration of the
 entire journey from a station close to home, to a station close to the campus. Additionally, the journey
 for each day consists of which station to start a ride on a line on and the end station on that line, after
 which the student either reaches the campus, or transfers to another line to continue their journey. Each
 days journey is constrained by a maximum duration, a maximum number of rides and transfers, and
 which modes of transportation are available due to strikes.
